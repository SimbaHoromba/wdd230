                When anyone goes on Netflix Website, they just want to sign up or sign
                in to watch movies or TV shows. To someone who has never heard of Netflix or someone who 
                is looking for a streaming website, when they see Netflix, they will easily know and understand
                that Netflix offers streaming services of movies and TV shows. The font, color and contrast Netflix uses
                three levels that can be accessed on desktop, smart TVs, and mobile phones. it looks the same on both
                devices which mean they use repetition that makes the visitor jump in right away to sign in.
                The words like unlimited movies, TV shows, and more, makes the viewer understand what Netflix offers without scrolling
                down to get More information. The purpose of the website is to lead people to sign up or sign in that is why there is few
                details on the main section of the main page and seeing that only, you are going to sign up.

            <p>
                Dropbox is one of the best websites that has the best white space between the design.
                The white space on the website brings great balance to the design and give the best 
                visual communication to the user. On this page you will find macro and micro white space.
                For an example, you will find micro white space in the margins of each design. micro element
                are the small space between the design. Macro space is found mostly in the center of the page.
                macro white space is the large space that is found on the major elements of the page. In this page 
                micro and macro white space is consistence.

            <img src="images/takealot.png" alt="Takealot">
            <p>
                Takealot gives the right number of choices to the user and makes it easier for the user
                to choose which product do they want. I have used it many times and the way it is designed
                made me not to wonder too much on what I should buy. The whole site and their app contain 
                and practice the Hick's law. You can also find other design principles that I have mentioned
                in other sections of this page. These design principles give the user the best and worth remembering
                experience and they will come back again to experience the calmness your website brings.
